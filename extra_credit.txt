Extra Credit:

I think that I went beyond the requirements because I learned Tkinter by myself and was able to execute an entire app-like structure for the idea that I had. Being an absolute beginner at coding while joining this class, I think I really challenged myself to create that app and I am really proud of myself too because it took a lot of time and effort for me. I wanted to try so much more and add it to my app but due to time constraints I couldn't. I was planning to add a backdrop (I tried a lot but couldn't get the image up. I kept getting errors) and have two input boxes so that the output name is based on both the animal type and animal color. Anyhow, learning the GUI Tkinter was an accomplishment for me and this project is something I can be proud of later, no matter how simple it is.
